TASK-7 : STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING NUMERICAL AND TEXTUAL ANALYSIS

Steps: Step 1: Stock Price Analysis and Prediction Step 1.1: Importing Required Libraries for numerical analysis and prediction of stock prices Technical Stack used :

Numpy Array Matplotlib Pandas Keras Scikit Learn Math Step 1.2: Importing the Numerical dataset and performing Exploratory Analysis Step 1.3: Creating a dataframe for storing the Closing stock data per day Step 1.4: Data Normalization and Division into Training and Test sets Step 1.5: Creating a LSTM Neural Network Model for Numerical Analysis Step 1.6 : Making Predictions of the Model Step 2: Textual Data(News Headlines) Analysis Step 2.1: Importing Required Libraries for Textual (News Headlines) analysis Step 2.2: Importing the Textual dataset and performing Exploratory Analysis

Step 2.5: Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines Step 3: Creating Hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines Step 3.1: Importing Required Libraries Step 3.2 : Importing the Numerical and Textual dataset Step 3.3: Creating Hybrid data from Numerical and Textual Data Step 3.4: Performing Sentiment Analysis on Hybrid Data Step 3.4.1: Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob Step 3.4.2: Adding subjectivity and polarity Scores to Textual Data (News Headlines) Step 3.4.3: Visualizing the polarity and Subjectivity scores Step 3.4.4: Performing Sentiment Analysis over the news Headlines of Hybrid Data Step 3.5: Training and Testing the Models for Stock Price/Performance Analysis

I have found the accuracy of each model as mention below:

The LSTM model can be tuned for various parameters such as changing the number of LSTM layers, adding dropout value or increasing the number of epochs. But are the predictions from LSTM enough to identify whether the stock price will increase or decrease? Certainly not!

As I mentioned at the start of the article, stock price is affected by the news about the company and other factors like demonetization or merger/demerger of the companies. There are certain intangible factors as well which can often be impossible to predict beforehand
